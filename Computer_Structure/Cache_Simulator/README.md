## Cache Simulator Assignment
- Make a cache simulator for a given files (.trace files)
- Assignment description
```
- The program outputs bits for each tag, index, and offset, and outputs total access and hit rate.
- Outputs an error message for five different error situations.
- The cache simulator requires four inputs.
1. .trace file
2. Cache's total byte
3. Cache block size in bytes per block
4. Associative. In the case of Direct mapped cache, 1 is the case, and the 4-way set adaptive cache is 4. Typically, the N value is entered in the N-way incidental cache.
